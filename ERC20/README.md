Installing and Running
----------------------

You MUST have Python3.6 installed.

Install solc: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html#binary-packages
(solc --version should give you a good output).

Install ethereum with pip: sudo python3.6 -m pip install ethereum

Then, run tests with run_tests.py


All tests should pass after completing the withdraw function.
